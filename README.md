# VCF-RESEARCH — Vector Cycle Framework

The Vector Cycle Framework (VCF) is a multi-phase, geometric, macro-market research system that transforms economic and market inputs into a unified geometric state-space.

This repository is structured as a **professional-grade quant research lab**, designed for:
- Claude (math/logic)
- GPT (engineering & architecture)
- Gemini (analysis)
- Copilot (file scaffolding, code generation)
- Human review

## 📐 VCF Framework Overview

VCF progresses through **four phases**:

### **Phase I — Regime Engine**
Macro + liquidity + credit + market risk → regime scores  
Outputs: MRF, PRF, CRF, regime labels

### **Phase II — Sector Engine**
Applies sector tilts and allocation overlays  
Outputs: sector weights, overlays, defensive/offensive sleeves

### **Phase III — Unified Engine**
Combines macro geometry, market geometry, sector signals  
Outputs: unified tilt vectors, probability state, model coherence

### **Phase IV — Wavelit Engine**
Advanced harmonic, oscillation, and wavelit analysis  
Outputs: harmonic envelopes, wave-phase vectors

## 🔀 Branch Model

```
main           → engines + math + structure + docs + pilots
data-lake      → raw datasets only (never merged into main)
archive        → deprecated work
feature/*      → for Copilot, Claude, and GPT to build modules
```
