# Pull Request Request: Repository Reorganization + Scaffolding Setup (VCF-RESEARCH)

**Author:** Jason Rudder  
**Request prepared by:** ChatGPT  
**Target model:** Claude (Anthropic)  
**Repository:** `rudder-research/VCF-RESEARCH`  
**Branch to create:** `repo-structure-bootstrap-v1`  
**Purpose:** Establish a clean research-grade architecture for the VCF Project and prepare scaffolding for geometry engine code.

---

# 🧭 PURPOSE OF THIS PR REQUEST

Claude — I need your help to **restructure the entire repository**, bring it up to research-grade organization, and establish the scaffolding for future modules (geometry engine, data loader, metrics registry, harmonics, etc.).

This PR is ONLY structural — no complex logic required yet.  
It sets up the foundation and syncs with the mathematical specification already drafted.

I (Jason) will upload additional code and notebooks later.

# ✅ TASK 1 — CREATE THE NEW DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

Replace any existing loose folders with this **canonical architecture**:

**Action for Claude:**
Create missing folders, move misplaced items, and delete obsolete folders such as `VFC_Mathematical_Engine.ipynb` that were left unclassified (should be relocated under `/docs/specs` or `/notebooks` depending on content).

---

# ✅ TASK 2 — RENAME THE SPEC FILE

The current file in repo:



vcf-geometry-spec-v1


**Rename to:**



docs/specs/VCF_Geometry_Spec_v1.md


Add a small header at the top:

```md
# VCF Geometry Engine Specification (v1)

Author: Jason Rudder  
Collaborators: ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot  
Purpose: Canonical mathematical rules for the VCF macro-financial geometry framework.

✅ TASK 3 — CREATE THE "STARTER SCAFFOLDING" CODE FILES

These files have no functionality yet — only structure and docstrings.

3.1 src/vcf/core/geometry_engine.py
"""
VCF Geometry Engine (Scaffolding)

Implements the mathematical specification from:
docs/specs/VCF_Geometry_Spec_v1.md

This module will include:
- vector construction
- normalization application
- angle / magnitude computation
- theta/phi system geometry
- coherence & resonance placeholders
"""

class GeometryEngine:
    def __init__(self, registry):
        self.registry = registry

    def build_state_vector(self, df_row):
        """Return a 7D macro-financial vector."""
        pass

    def compute_geometry(self, vector):
        """Compute magnitude, theta, phi, coherence, resonance."""
        pass

3.2 src/vcf/utils/normalization.py
"""
Normalization utilities for all VCF metrics.
Includes z-scoring, clipping, and min-max normalization
as defined in the geometry specification.
"""

def zscore(series):
    pass

def minmax(series):
    pass

def clip_values(series, low=-3, high=3):
    pass

3.3 src/vcf/data/loader.py
"""
Loader: high-level access point for raw/clean datasets.
"""

def load_clean_panel(path):
    pass

def load_raw_metric(name, directory):
    pass

3.4 src/vcf/utils/helpers.py
"""Misc utilities used across VCF."""

✅ TASK 4 — CREATE A ROOT README.md

Claude — overwrite or create a new README:

# VCF Research Project

This repository implements the **Vector Cycle Framework (VCF)** —  
a macro-financial geometry system that models markets as evolving vectors in a multidimensional state-space.

## Key Components

- **Geometry Engine** — converts macro & market data into a 7D normalized vector
- **Harmonic Tools** — coherence, resonance, divergence, rotation
- **Stress Index (future)** — detects instability or regime breaks
- **Data Pipeline** — FRED + Yahoo Finance collection and preprocessing
- **Visualization Suite** — plots, dashboards, and vector field maps

## Current Status
- Phase I complete: Mathematical specification finalized  
- Phase II begins here: repository restructuring + scaffolding  
- Phase III will implement the geometry engine  

✅ TASK 5 — REQUIREMENTS FILE

Add a minimal requirements.txt:

numpy
pandas
scipy
matplotlib
pyyaml
plotly

🚀 FINAL TASK for CLAUDE

Create a new branch:

repo-structure-bootstrap-v1


Perform ALL changes above, commit them, and then open a Pull Request to main.

Title of PR:

VCF Repository Restructure + Core Scaffolding (Bootstrap v1)


Description:

This PR restructures the entire repository into the canonical architecture,
moves spec files into /docs/specs, and sets up the initial scaffolding 
for core modules (geometry engine, normalization utilities, data loader, etc.).
No functional code yet — this is foundational infrastructure.

🧠 NOTES FOR CLAUDE

This repo will be jointly maintained by Claude + ChatGPT + Copilot.

Follow the spec exactly; do not invent additional folders unless necessary.

Keep filenames lowercase (PEP8), except for markdown specs which use Title_Case.

Do not attempt to implement the math — only scaffolding and structure.
