# VCF Pilot Test Suite – Mathematical Validation Framework

## Overview  
A **Pilot** in VCF Research is now defined as a *mathematically isolated test module* used to validate every foundational component of our system.

This scientific test layer ensures that:
- Each formula is correctly implemented  
- Inputs behave as expected  
- Outputs match theoretical behavior  
- Edge-case behavior is numerically stable  
- Interpretation aligns with the VCF paradigm  

This document defines the official **Pilot Test Suite** for all phases.

# Phase I — Regime_Engine  
**Economic Regime Engine**  
Tests confirm the correctness of macro + liquidity geometry.

## Math Tests  
1. **Z-score correctness**
2. **Pillar averaging stability**
3. **Angle identity tests**
   - atan2 symmetry  
   - θ quadrant correctness
4. **Coherence positivity**
5. **Economic cycle validation** using known historical macro cycles
6. **Leading / lagging correlation checks**
7. **Synthetic macro signal tests** (sinusoid → expected angle path)

## Expected Outputs  
- Correct θ transitions across synthetic and historical data  
- Verified leading indicators  
- Verified confirming and lagging indicators

# Phase III — Unified_Engine  
**Unified State Space Engine**  
Combines macro + sectors + harmonics into a single 3D VCF geometry.

# Phase IV — Wavelit_Engine  
**Wavelet + Resonance Regime Engine**  
Time–frequency cycle analysis and macro–market resonance.

## Math Tests  
1. **CWT admissibility**
2. **Wavelet power conservation**
3. **Scale-to-frequency mapping correctness**
4. **Short/long cycle wavelet ratio consistency**
5. **Dominant cycle detection**

# Scientific Goal  
This Pilot Test Suite moves VCF from a model into a **fully scientific framework**, where each mathematical building block is validated independently before integration.

This is how new paradigms are built.
