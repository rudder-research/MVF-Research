# VCF Research — Limited 4-Input Prototype (Process-Only Trial)
### Pull Request Instructions for Claude

Claude — this is a **limited, simple trial run** for workflow testing.  
This is *not* the full VCF Geometry Engine.  
This run is only to verify process, structure, and ZIP output compatibility.

Please follow the instructions below exactly.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Create a **4-input prototype pipeline** that demonstrates:

- clean file organization  
- modular small Python scripts  
- readable workflow  
- proper folder structure  
- correct ZIP packaging for GitHub  

The prototype does **not** need advanced math or modeling logic.

---

## 📦 Inputs (Exactly These Four)

1. **S&P 500 — 50-day / 200-day moving average ratio**  
2. **10-Year Treasury Yield**  
3. **VIX**  
4. **DXY (US Dollar Index)**

Treat each input as a simple time series.  
No domain knowledge required.  
No forecasting.  
No modeling algorithms.

This is *process only.*

---

## 📁 Required Folder Structure (Output as a ZIP)

Please generate a ZIP with a structure similar to:





You may adjust filenames as needed, but keep everything:

- organized  
- modular  
- consistent  

---

## 🧩 Required Python Scripts (Minimal)

Each script should be **short, clean, and easy to read**.

### Required functionality:

- load each dataset  
- compute SP500 50-day / 200-day MA ratio  
- normalize each input (simple linear scaling is fine)  
- assemble a combined vector per timestamp  
- save final results to:  
  **`outputs/state_vectors.csv`**

Keep all math extremely basic.

---

## 📘 README Requirements

Include a small **README.txt** that describes:

- what the pipeline does  
- what each folder contains  
- how to run the scripts  
- that this is a **limited 4-input prototype for process testing only**

No extra interpretation needed.

---

## 📤 Output Requirement

Return **one ZIP archive** containing:

- the folder structure  
- all scripts  
- sample data files  
- the combined output CSV  
- the README  

No additional commentary outside the ZIP.

---

## ⚠️ Constraints

- Keep math simple  
- Do *not* add geometric or harmonic modeling  
- Do *not* add complex analysis  
- Do *not* modify scope  
- ZIP output is required  
- Keep code and folders clean and readable  
- This is only a workflow test  

---

## ✔ Purpose

This test ensures your ZIP-based workflow integrates cleanly with my GitHub process.  
The full VCF Geometry Engine will be implemented in the next phase.

Thanks.
