## Log Format

Each entry should include:
- **Date**: When the work was done
- **Author**: Who performed the work
- **Topic**: Brief description of what was worked on
- **Details**: Findings, results, or decisions
- **Next Steps**: Follow-up actions needed

## Entries

### [Date] - Repository Organization
**Author**: [Name]  
**Topic**: Project Structure Reorganization

**Details**:
- Reorganized repository into clear directory structure
- Created `/notebooks`, `/src`, `/assets`, `/docs` directories
- Moved existing files to appropriate locations
- Added README files for all major directories
- Created `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts
- Documented data sources in `DATA_SOURCES.md`

**Changes Made**:
- Notebooks moved to `/notebooks/`
- Python modules moved to `/src/`
- Documentation moved to `/docs/`
- Archives moved to `/assets/`
- Updated main README with new structure

**Next Steps**:
- Update notebook imports to reflect new `/src/` location
- Document specific data retrieval dates in `DATA_SOURCES.md`
- Add project-specific content to directory READMEs
- Consider adding unit tests for `/src/` modules
