## Phase I — Regime_Engine (Economic Regime Engine)

### Purpose
Identify leading, confirming, and lagging economic indicators. Build economic geometry and economic cycle regimes.

### Core Math
- Z-score normalization
- Macro pillar M(t)
- Liquidity pillar L(t)
- Economic geometry:
  - θ = atan2(M, L)
  - Cθ = sqrt(M² + L²)
- Economic regime mapping (contraction → expansion → overheating)

### Output
Economic regime time series + geometric coordinates.

## Phase II — Sector_Regime_Engine (Sector Regime Engine)

### Purpose
Model sector interactions, sector leadership, lagging, synchrony, divergence, harmonic signatures, and sector-cycle structure.  
**Novel contribution:** _formalized Sector Regime theory._

### Core Math
- Sector normalization (SPY, sectors, VIX)
- Sector pillar E(t)
- Sector-risk geometry:
  - φ = atan2(E, R)
  - Cφ = sqrt(E² + R²)
- Sector dispersion (std of sector z-scores)
- Sector breadth (% of sectors > 0)
- Harmonic structure:
  - Short-cycle power
  - Long-cycle power
  - Harmonic ratio
  - Dominant period

### Output
Sector regime identification + harmonic cycle diagnostics.

## Phase III — Unified_Engine (Unified State Space Engine)

### Purpose
Combine macro + sector + harmonic metrics into a unified state vector.  
Derive low-dimensional VCF Geometry: Θ_VCF, Φ_VCF, R_VCF.

### Core Math
- Unified feature vector X(t)
- PCA → 3D coordinates Y1, Y2, Y3
- Unified geometry angles:
  - Θ_VCF = atan2(Y2, Y1)
  - Φ_VCF = atan2(Y3, Y1)
  - R_VCF = sqrt(Y1² + Y2² + Y3²)

### Output
Unified VCF geometry (full system state).

---

## Phase IV — Wavelit_Engine (Wavelet + Regime Engine)

### Purpose
Wavelet decomposition, multi-scale cycle detection, macro–market resonance, full regime classification.

### Core Math
- CWT wavelet transform
- Wavelet power spectrum
- Scale-to-period conversion
- Short vs long wavelet power ratios
- Dominant cycle length
- Phase alignment and resonance:
  - Resonance = cos(Δφ at dominant macro frequency)

### Output
Final VCF regimes + resonance maps + time-frequency cycle atlas.

## Summary

This plan represents the official layered architecture for VCF Research.  
Each engine builds on the previous one to form a complete, multi-scale, geometric, and wavelet-driven research system.
