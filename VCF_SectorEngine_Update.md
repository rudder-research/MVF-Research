# VCF Engine Architecture – Updated with Sector_Engine

## Final Phase Structure (Simplified & Clean)

```
Regime_Engine        # Phase I — Economic Regime Engine
Sector_Engine        # Phase II — Sector Interaction & Structure
Unified_Engine       # Phase III — Full-System Geometry
Wavelit_Engine       # Phase IV — Wavelet + Resonance Regime Engine
```

This naming is intentionally simple, scalable, and easy for Claude and all AI collaborators to implement and maintain.

# Phase I — Regime_Engine  
**Purpose:**  
Economic geometry, leading/lagging indicator analysis, macro cycle classification.

**Core Math:**  
- Z-score normalization  
- Macro pillar M(t)  
- Liquidity pillar L(t)  
- θ = atan2(M, L)  
- Cθ = sqrt(M² + L²)  
- Macro regime mapping  

---

# Phase II — Sector_Engine  
**Purpose:**  
Analyze sector interactions, leadership/lagging structure, sector cycles, and internal sector regimes.

This is a **novel concept** — turning sector dynamics into their own regime system.

**Core Math:**  
- Sector normalization  
- Sector pillar E(t)  
- Risk pillar R(t)  
- φ = atan2(E, R)  
- Cφ = sqrt(E² + R²)  
- Sector dispersion  
- Sector breadth  
- Harmonic features (cycle power, dominant period)  

---

# Phase III — Unified_Engine  
**Purpose:**  
Combine macro + sector + harmonic features into a unified VCF state space.

**Core Math:**  
- Unified feature vector X(t)  
- PCA → Y1, Y2, Y3  
- Θ_VCF, Φ_VCF, R_VCF  
- Unified geometry  
- Preliminary unified regimes  

---

# Phase IV — Wavelit_Engine  
**Purpose:**  
CWT-based wavelet system, multi-scale cycle detection, macro–sector resonance, final VCF regimes.

**Core Math:**  
- Continuous Wavelet Transform  
- Wavelet power spectrum  
- Short/long power ratios  
- Dominant frequency  
- Resonance = cos(Δφ at macro’s dominant frequency)  
- Integration into full VCF state space

# Repo Organization Planning  
You will upload your full GitHub repo, and I will:

### ✔ Scan & report the structure  
### ✔ Identify duplication, clutter, and drift  
### ✔ Map where engines live (currently `VCF-RESEARCH/vcf/`)  
### ✔ Recommend a clean, final structure  
### ✔ Ensure no important code or math is disrupted  

This will be done file by file, folder by folder.

We will turn the repo from “chaotic exploration” → **research-grade architecture**.

# Next Step  
When you upload everything to GitHub, just say:

**“Analyze my repo and produce the structure report.”**  

I’ll handle the full mapping.
